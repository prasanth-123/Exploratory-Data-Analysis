# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

• We collected the influenza data from the CDC website.

• Then, we plotted the heatmap for the flu data in order to produce a measure of influenza like illness activity by state in USA.

• Then we collected twitter data using the search query ‘flu’ & ‘influenza’.

• We then plotted the heatmap using the collected twitter data.

• Then the results were deployed in the ShinyR app for comparison and analysis.

• The screenshots for the heatmap comparison on ShinyR are shown below.
